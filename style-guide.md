# Style Guide

Welcome to the Toca style guide! Following this guide ensures that our documentation remains consistent, readable, and maintainable. Please adhere to these standards when contributing to the project.

## Table of contents



## File Naming Conventions

- ***IMPORTANT*** - Follow and utilise the structured numbering conventions, such as 01-, 02-, etc. Since files are automatically arranged in alphabetical order, we use these numerical prefixes to maintain a clear hierarchical structure. This ensures that readers can easily follow the sequence and organisation of our guides.
- Use lowercase letters, and separate words with hyphens (e.g., `user-guide.md`).
- Be descriptive and clear in naming to reflect the content of the file.
- Avoid using special characters or spaces in file names.
- Where possible name the file to the section or task you are going to articulate.

## Folder Structure 

- ***IMPORTANT*** - Follow and utilise the structured numbering conventions, such as 01-, 02-, etc. Since files are automatically arranged in alphabetical order, we use these numerical prefixes to maintain a clear hierarchical structure. This ensures that readers can easily follow the sequence and organisation of our guides.
- Each guide ***MUST*** be set up as a folder containing a folder called `img` and the file `example-guide.md`. This is to ensure consistency and modularity of each guide.

## Images

- Please ensure that images are of high clarity and resolution so that their quality is maintained, even when utilised elsewhere.
- Name your images to describe, as accurately as possible, the screen, location, object, etc., to facilitate ease of management if changes are needed.
- We are happy for all types of images i.e. PNG, JPG, etc. When using or creating gifs please ensure they fully show the process intended and are not confusing for users.

## Structure of Content

- **Header Naming:** Ensure the header is the same name as the named file.
- **Table of Contents:** Include a table of contents at the beginning of long documents to help readers navigate.
- **Headings:** Use appropriate headings (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`) to structure content. Ensure a logical hierarchy.
- **Consistent Sections:** Maintain consistent sections across similar documents (e.g., Introduction, Usage, Examples) to enhance readability.
- **Bullet Points and Numbering:** Use bullet points and numbering for lists and step-by-step instructions.

## Toca Document Template

Please utilise the structure within the [toca-doc-template.md](TBD). Simply create your Markdown file and copy and pate the template to get started.

## Utilise a Markdown Editor

- Use a Markdown editor that provides preview functionality and linting suggestions to ensure that the content is rendered as intended.
- Tools like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Markdown extensions can be valuable in this process.

## Adhere to Linting Suggestions

- Follow linting suggestions for regular spacing, indentation, and line length.
- Consider using tools like [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) to maintain consistency.

## Markdown Guidelines

- Use Markdown syntax consistently.
- Include alt text for images to enhance accessibility.
- Use code blocks with language identifiers for code snippets (e.g., \```javascript).
- Ensure that links are descriptive and meaningful.

## General User Guide Documentation Guidelines

- Write in clear, concise language, avoiding jargon.
- Include examples, screenshots, or diagrams where they add value.
- Maintain a consistent tone and voice that aligns with your project's brand or community.
- Provide contact information or links to additional resources for readers seeking further assistance or information.
