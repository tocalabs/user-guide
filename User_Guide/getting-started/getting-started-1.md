#### What is Toca?

 
Toca is a cloud-first, all-in-one Enterprise Automation Platform (EAP) which is split into four different products:


- Automation


- Apps


- Analytics


- Toca Development Kit (TDK)

Each product, whilst they stand on their own, integrates tightly with the other products in the platform to allow you to meet any business requirements.
This lets you automate and schedule business processes, build web applications, process data and extend the platform to fit your needs; all from a single web interface.

### How is it Organised?

 
Both Automation and Apps are split into projects. A project is a collection of linked items; usually the items in a project will relate to a business area or be focused on a particular business process.
 
**Automation Projects** represent workspaces for creating and running automated workflows. An automation project is created to store and manage all the related resources such as activities, workflows, datastores and schedules. A project is linked to an individual user and can be created by any user who has the project role.

**App Projects** represent workspaces for creating, publishing and managing Apps. An App project stores a single App and allows the user to create pages for the App, edit the content and control who has access.

**Toca Development Kit** is a space where you can extend the current functionality of your Toca platform. Inside the TDK you can write new actions that can be used in your automation projects or you can write new user interface (UI) components that you can use in your Apps.


#### What can I do with it?

**Automation**. Automate business processes by creating activities and orchestrate them using workflows. Automation in Toca lets you automate complex processes with simple, no code, drag and drop actions. This will let you automate any software and provide limitless integration options. You can then schedule these automated activities to run at any time, 24/7, 365 days a year and these will run on virtual workers known as *Bots*.


**Apps**. Create multi-page web applications using drag and drop components which can have user authorisation if required. You can also link your Apps to your automation projects so you can actually trigger automation workflows from the click of a button in your App. You can build anything from static blog style websites to fully-fledged and immersive web applications which can then be published with the click of a button. ([https://toca.io](https://toca.io/) is actually built using Toca Apps!)


**TDK**. Extend the platform\'s functionality by editing or creating new actions for Automation and new components for Apps. This lets you add functionality to the platform that might not already exist allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Any new functionality developed in the TDK will be available to all users on your platform.
