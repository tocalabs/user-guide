#### Projects

A project is a container for a collection of related automation entities such as activities, workflows and datastores. In general, a project will relate to a business area or a single business process. Structuring projects well makes managing your Toca platform much simpler and easier to navigate.
To get started with a project, click on the project item in the side navigation bar:

Once you have clicked on the Projects icon you'll see a screen similar to this one:

You'll notice on the left hand side of the screen we have Automation projects and on the right hand side you have Apps. We're going to focus on Automation for now.

#### Create and Edit a Project

To create a new project click the *NEW +* button:


![Projects 3](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/Projects%203.png?width=422&name=Projects%203.png) 

Give your Automation project a name and a description:

Once you have done that click *CREATE*


![Projects 5](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/Projects%205.png?width=502&name=Projects%205.png) 

Once you have created a project you will be taken into the Project view and you'll see an empty project similar to the one below.

We'll explore what all these different things inside a Project are in the next section.
Now you have created a Project, you may wish to rename it or change its description if the nature of the work has changed since you first made it.
To do this go back to the Projects page by clicking on the projects icon. Once you are on the projects page, click on the options on the project you wish to change:

![Projects 7](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/Projects%207.png?width=602&name=Projects%207.png) 

This menu includes the option to edit the project

![Projects 8](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/Projects%208.png?width=445&name=Projects%208.png) 

Click on edit to change the name or description and click UPDATE

#### Copy a Project

To copy a project, go to the Projects page and find the project you wish to duplicate. Once you have found it, click on the projects menu:

![Projects 10](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/Projects%2010.png?width=602&name=Projects%2010.png) 

And then click the Duplicate option

![Projects 11](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/Projects%2011.png?width=602&name=Projects%2011.png) 

After a short period of time you'll see a duplicate project render in your Projects list:

![Image](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sxJTIhsf4uYDQMVjbbaOvwrrd8YttkOoAfD0ZMhkEriqBus6A4jjJNAVDNMUmuUfEKk2G-4LWffdiD9iphv_3m_rb7EaChoawzzDzVr7FgFRiZODfY098agptKxA8iTtIzto5HZA) 

Be sure to rename it to something different to avoid confusion in the future. The projects will be identical, but it may be worth noting that the duplicate version will appear at the top of the projects list (above the original).

#### Remove a Project

If a project is no longer needed then you can remove it and all of its contents by simply opening the projects menu:

![Projects 13](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/Projects%2013.png?width=531&name=Projects%2013.png) 

Then click the Delete option

![Projects 14](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/Projects%2014.png?width=602&name=Projects%2014.png) 

A pop up will appear asking for confirmation as deleting a project is a non reversible action. Deleting a project will also remove all associated resources from inside the project so all activities, workflows, datastores and schedules will be deleted too.
