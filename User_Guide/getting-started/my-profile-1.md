### My Permissions

 
Each user has a set of permissions or roles associated with their account. The roles filter what parts of the platform your user can access and use. By default, when a user is created they have no roles so it is up to the administrator who creates your user to assign the correct and necessary permissions. Most accounts will have all permissions except for the Admin role.
If you are unable to access a part of the system that you were expecting to then get in contact with your platform administrator and ask them to update your permissions accordingly.
