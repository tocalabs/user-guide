## What is Automation in Toca?

At its core, automation is about reducing manual effort in tasks. In the context of Toca, automation specifically denotes executing portions or entire business processes without human intervention. How? Via virtual workers named "Bots".

Imagine these Bots as digital employees, capable of working tirelessly around the clock. Just as you might operate software on a Windows or Linux system, a Bot mimics these interactions – from simple tasks like clicking the mouse or typing on a keyboard to advanced operations like data extraction from web pages, reading text from images, and even integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) functionalities. The real magic with Toca's Bots? They handle tasks at speeds and efficiencies that humans simply can't match.

## Choosing the Right Task for Automation

Before diving into automation, it's essential to pick the right business process. Ideal automation targets generally:

* Are repeatable.
* Have well-defined rules.
* Can be dissected into smaller, manageable steps.

While Toca empowers you to automate nearly any task, it's worth noting that not every task should be automated. For instance, a one-time task might consume more time in automation than just doing it manually. So, always weigh the benefits against the effort required.
