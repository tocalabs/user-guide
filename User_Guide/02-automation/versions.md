# Upgrading Action Versions



 
As new features are added to actions, new versions of the actions are created. When there is a new version available of an action you'll notice an *Upgrade Available* button appear in the bottom right hand corner of the affected actions.

The screenshot shows an Image Click action which has an update available.

To start the upgrade process, click on the button and this will trigger a pop up to appear. The pop up let's you know information about the upgrade.

Here you can see that there is an Image Click version 3 available and it is ready to use. You can also see there is an option to upgrade all image click version 2 actions in the activity to version 3 at the same time.
Once you have selected your preferred option it will perform the upgrade for you and you can tell your action has been upgraded by the version in the bottom right hand corner of the action card.

You can also set the version of an action manually by opening the action in question and clicking the version in the top right corner as shown below.

Clicking on this triggers a pop up which shows all versions that you can set the action to. Simply click on the one that suits your use case.

It is worth noting that you don't have to upgrade when there is an upgrade available, if your activity works just fine with the versions it currently uses then there is no need to upgrade.
