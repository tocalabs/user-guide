# Importing and Exporting Projects



 
Sometimes you may want to export your Project so you can take a local backup or you may wish to migrate a Project from one Toca platform to another. This is where the  Import and Export functionality comes into play.
You can export any Automation Project and you'll receive an email with a download link where you can download your automation Project. An exported Project is simply a compressed folder containing various files that make up your Project. An export will include:


- Activities


- Workflows


- Datastores


- Schedules

An export will not include:


- Listeners


- Bots

Once you have exported your Project you can manually edit the files if you wish or just use the export as a local backup of your Project. Alternatively, you could send the exported Project to someone else to use with their Toca account. Or you could import the exported Project into a different Toca platform.
An import will include everything inside the exported Project. It is worth noting that any activities which were assigned to a Bot that the new user does not have access to will need to have new Bots assigned to them before they work.

#### How to Export

To export a Project, navigate to the Projects page using the Project button in the navbar on the left side.

Click this option to start an export of the Project. As Projects can contain 100's of activities, workflows and datastores this process can take some time. You will receive an email when the export is complete and the email will include a download link for the export.
 
Alternatively, you can go to the Exports part of Toca where you can see all your exports and decide whether to download them from there or delete them. To navigate to the exports page, click on the Exports icon on the navigation bar on the left hand side.
