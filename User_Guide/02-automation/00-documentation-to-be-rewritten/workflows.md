# Introduction to workflows



 
A Workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activities. In Toca, the Workflow is the highest level of automation, it is the final stage where you put all your activities together to represent your business process. The workflow may be considered a view or representation of the real work.
Workflows use the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation)] iconography so that a Workflow comes across as a map of your business process.

#### Create a Workflow

To create a workflow, go to the project page which contains the activities you wish to orchestrate.

This will show a pop up asking you to provide a name and a description for the new Workflow.

Once you have given it a relevant name and description, click CREATE. This will open the Workflow to the [Workflow Designer](https://docs.toca.io/knowledge/workflow-designer), more on that later.

#### Edit a Workflow

If you wish to change the name or description of a workflow then go to the project page for the project that contains your Workflow you wish to edit. Find the Workflow on the project page; you cannot edit the Workflow from the quick access list at the top of the project menu so you will have to scroll down the project page to find it.

Once you have found the workflow, hover over it to reveal a menu as shown below by the red box.

This will show a pop up which lets you update the name and/or the description. Once you have finished editing, click update to save your changes.

#### Copy a Workflow

To copy a Workflow, open the project which contains the Workflow you wish to copy and navigate to the workflow on the project page.
Hover over the Workflow to reveal a menu as shown below.

A new workflow will then appear with the same name but with *(copy)* appended to the end.

It is always a good idea to rename the copy to something more meaningful to avoid confusion in the future.

#### Remove a Workflow

To remove a workflow from a Project, open the project which contains the Workflow. Scroll down the project page until you find the Workflow you wish to remove.
Once you have found the Workflow in question, hover over it to reveal a menu.

Click the bin icon as shown in the screenshot above and this will trigger a pop up asking you to confirm your action as removing a workflow is an irreversible process.

Click YES to continue and remove the Workflow and click No to keep the Workflow.
