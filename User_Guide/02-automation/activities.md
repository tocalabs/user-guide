# Creating, updating, copying, and removing activities



 
Activities are the most fundamental component of your Automation projects. They form the reusable blocks with which you can build bigger and more complex Workflows by assembling them into Workflows.
It is best practice to keep Activities focused on a specific aspect of the business process you are automating, and building up complexity through combining many Activities in a Workflow. How you build and combine Activities is ultimately up to you and as you use Toca you will develop a style that suits you.

#### Create an Activity

To add an activity, open up a project and click the Add Activity button at the top of the project page.

![Activities 1](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Activities%201.png?width=602&name=Activities%201.png) 

Much like when you created a project, it will ask you to specify a name and a description for the activity.

The name and description should give a high level overview of what it does.
You'll notice that unlike a project, an Activity also asks you to specify a Bot. An Activity can be associated with a single Bot at a time, the Bot that is associated is the one which will run the Activity. 
If you have no Bots assigned to your user then you cannot create an Activity as you have no resources to run the activity on. If you do have a Bot assigned to your user then you can complete the form and hit CREATE.

#### Update an Activity

To edit the name, description or the associated Bot of an Activity then you must first find the activity you wish to change in the Activity section of the project page.

Hover over the activity and a menu will appear with an edit icon on

![Activities 5](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Activities%205.png?width=333&name=Activities%205.png) 

Click on the Edit icon and a pop up will appear allowing you to change the name, description or associated Bot. Once you have made your changes click UPDATE.

#### Copy an Activity

Hover over an activity you wish to copy in the project view, this will show an activities menu.

![Activities 7](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Activities%207.png?width=301&name=Activities%207.png) 

Click on the duplicate button, highlighted above by the red box. This will create a duplicate activity, make sure to rename it so that it doesn't cause any confusion in the future!

#### Copy an Activity to another Project

Sometimes it is necessary to perform the same automated task across a number of different business processes. We recognise that there is the need for this occasionally and so you can copy activities between different projects.
To do this, hover over an activity to show its menu and click on the Copy to project icon highlighted below in red.

![Activities 9](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Activities%209.png?width=602&name=Activities%209.png) 

This will trigger a pop up asking you which project you wish to copy the activity to. It also allows you to copy other activities to this project at the same time.
Once you have selected your preferences click COPY to complete the copy to another project.

#### Remove an Activity

If an activity is no longer needed, then you can remove it by clicking the Bin icon on an activities menu.

![Activities 10](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Activities%2010.png?width=602&name=Activities%2010.png) 

After clicking the icon, a pop up will appear asking you for confirmation to delete the activity (this is because deleting an activity is an irreversible process).
