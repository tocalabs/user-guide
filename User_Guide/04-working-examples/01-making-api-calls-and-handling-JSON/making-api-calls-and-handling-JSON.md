## Introduction to API Calls

In today's interconnected digital landscape, API calls serve as the critical links between different systems and services. Whether you're dealing with JSON, XML, or any other bespoke data format, API calls facilitate the transfer of data between servers and services. This section explores how to make GET and POST calls using Toca and how to parse the returned data into a Toca datastore.

## The Working Example

For this working example, we will assume the need to create two services: one that captures the area of a postcode and another that captures the postcode itself. We will be using the open-source [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/) service for this purpose.
