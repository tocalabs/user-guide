Event listeners are a way for components to listen for certain events so that they can trigger a function. This can be useful for updating a value through in-page logic amongst other things. You will notice when looking at the properties of a component that there is a field named 'Event listener name', which is populated with a long randomised string. The string in this case is: '**e1b9d905-9999-4ee0-bfd7-cbe1a7e2e83f_toggleTransition',** but it is highly recommended that you rename the event listener to something simpler if you intend to use it.

In this case, we will rename it simply to 'Toggle'. Purely for the sake of this example we will also uncheck the option labelled 'Component displayed on page load'.

Drag a card into the transition layout. This has no function other than to disappear/appear through the transition layout and so here you could use an image etc.
