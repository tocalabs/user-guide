An App Project is a place to create, store and manage your apps pages and user authentication. They contain: 


- Pages


- Users table


- Published status

Each app project comes with a large number of tools to help you build any web App you want.

#### What is an App?

Apps allow you to create apps and portals that you can deploy to the web in seconds. An App can be anything from a single page blog to a multi-page web app; you can make an App available to anyone or you can require a user to sign in to use your App. Like the Automation part of Toca, Apps champion the no-code approach so you can build your App with easy drag-and-drop components. You don't need to know anything about web development to be productive with Apps.

#### What can I do with an App?

Apps are incredibly versatile; you can make anything with them. From your company\'s website (see [https://toca.io](https://toca.io/) - which was built and deployed using Apps), to a fully fledged enterprise platform.

 
Whilst an App can work on its own in much the same way that Automation works on its own, you can actually integrate your automation into your apps. Have a Workflow that takes inputs? Why not add a form to your App that takes user inputs and starts the Workflow with those inputs? Want to display the outputs from a Workflow? Just link a content component with your Workflows outputs. 
 
If your App is only designed to be used by a handful of people then just add user authentication. Want to link your Office365 accounts with your App so you can log into an App using your work account? This can easily be accomplished. The App setup wizard will take you through this and you can have an App designed and published to the web in minutes, not weeks.
