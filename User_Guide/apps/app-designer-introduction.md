The App Designer is where you design and style each page of your App. Like the Activity Designer it is a no-code environment where you drag and drop the items you want onto the canvas. Each page of your App starts as a blank page and you can build it up by adding layouts to your page and content to those layouts. You enter the App Designer when you open a page from the App project page.

The App requires users to login to use it and is unpublished.

The users table can be found on the right hand side of the App project.

#### Navigate the App Designer

When you go to design a page this will open the App Designer.

![screenshot.1](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.1.jpg?width=602&name=screenshot.1.jpg) 

The App Designer is split into five different sections:


- A list of the components can be found on the left hand side in a slide out tab. These are grouped into layouts, components and forms.


- Blocks as a slide out tab on the left, below components.


- The page itself which takes up the majority of the page.


- Properties as a slide out tab on the right.


- The Explorer displays and lets you select, move every component on the page.

You drag the components from the top bar onto the page to place them down; you can change the styling and other properties of a component once it is placed using the properties tab. Blocks allow you to group common layouts and create them as a single block which you can use in your other Apps. 

#### Components

Components are split into three main categories:


- Layouts


- Content


- Form

A layout component lets you structure a page and split your page up into regions. You can split up your page by using grids, navbars, heroes and cards to mention a few. Once you have placed down a layout you can start to add content to your page, content *MUST* be placed inside a layout element, otherwise there is no way of knowing where to render the content! Content components let you add text, images, menus and carousels to your page as well as many more types of content. The components under the Form category let you integrate your App with automation Workflows and Datastores. Form components allow you to get users inputs to start a workflow with or display the outputs from a Workflow. 

To place a component down onto a page just drag it from the components tab and drop it onto the page where you want it to appear.
 

![screenshot.2](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.2.jpg?width=602&name=screenshot.2.jpg) 

Once you have placed a component down on the page click on it. When you click on it a little context menu will appear at the top left corner of the component.

![screenshot.3](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.3.jpg?width=602&name=screenshot.3.jpg) 

This menu allows you to do the following (from left to right):


- Up arrow - allows you to select the parent component to the one currently selected, useful for selecting layout components.


- Block - Create a block from the current component and it's children.


- Duplicate - Copy the component and paste it just after the currently selected component.


- In Page Logic: Opens the event viewer for In Page Logic. More on this later.


- Delete - Remove the component from the page.


#### Properties

Each component has its own properties which allow you to modify the styling or alter the content of the component. To change a component\'s properties simply click on the component once you have placed it on the page and then expand the Properties tab on the right hand side.

![screenshot.4](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.4.jpg?width=602&name=screenshot.4.jpg) 

Most components share the following properties:


- Width


- Height


- Margin


- Padding


- Border


- Shadow

But, some components will have additional properties which let you change the colour or font if relevant.
Place some components down and look at the properties panel for each one to see how they differ between components.

#### Blocks

Blocks are a group of preconfigured and styled components which have been combined together to make a single component. Blocks are incredibly useful when you have a number of Apps which contain a repeating layout. There are some blocks which come as standard to get you started. These blocks are:


- Login template


- Hero template

 
To use a block simply expand the Blocks menu on the left side and drag in the block you want to use onto your page.

![screenshot.5](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.5.jpg?width=602&name=screenshot.5.jpg) 

Unlike regular components you don't need to drag a block into a layout as a block provides its own layout.

![screenshot.6](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.6.jpg?width=602&name=screenshot.6.jpg) 

To create your own blocks click on the layout you have placed down which contains everything you want for your block. 

![screenshot.3](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.3.jpg?width=602&name=screenshot.3.jpg) 

This will reveal a little context menu above the component which contains a block button.

![screenshot.7](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.7.jpg?width=294&name=screenshot.7.jpg) 

Click on this button to turn the currently selected component and everything inside it into a single block. A window will appear asking you to give the new block a name and it will show you a preview of what the block looks like.

Once you have given the block a relevant name click CREATE.

![App Designer introduction 15](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/App%20Designer%20introduction%2015.png?width=602&name=App%20Designer%20introduction%2015.png) 

Once you have created a block you can view it in the Blocks menu on the left side.

![Image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b1ELolkMC0VRIYCXr5k8DotrAJFK3zGfN6hd8guGHxPIt5I8LHwkytNVKgIr0FWnx73uhG392E27epocCyPCEr9kS2RoC42aSvQ8NJOXZV807rRcEvt7jHEm0yPo_Pmh7dfg-kh2) 

You can now use this block in any App on your platform.

#### App

As well as the components, the ribbon across the top of the contains important functionality:


- Save - Allows you to save your App


- Preview - Allows you to preview how your App will look when it is published without having to publish it


- App Settings - Edit and modify the configuration you applied when you created the app. Change linked resources, add user authentication etc.


- Publish - Publish your app


- Viewport - Change the viewport that you are designing or previewing app in


![screenshot.8](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/book%20of%20toca%20images/book%20of%20toca%20updated%20images%20(13.10.21)/Apps/navigate%20app%20designer/screenshot.8.jpg?width=562&name=screenshot.8.jpg) 

Publishing will be covered in more detail towards the end of this chapter and settings were covered when you created the App so we'll focus on the other features.
 
**Save.** This will save any changes you have made. The save not only applies to pages you have open and are editing but any pages you've made changes to or closed.

**Preview.** Previewing your App lets you see what it will look like when it is published from within the App Designer. You can also change the viewport to see what the App will look like on a mobile device or tablet.

**Viewport.** This changes the viewport that you are designing or previewing the App in. There are four viewport options:



- All


- Laptop


- Tablet


- Mobile



- All


- Laptop


- Tablet


- Mobile

Any design work done when the viewport is in \'All\' will affect all the viewports but any design work done in the other three will only take effect when the App is being viewed from a device that matches the viewport. This makes it really easy to design Apps that look great across all three different sizes of screens.
