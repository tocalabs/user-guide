The Apps section contains the same as the automation section with the addition of the `New from template` option. As you build your Apps projects out you may want to create templates to ensure a common theme across all of your app products.

## The Pipelines Page

Pipelines is essentially a process log of your Automation and Apps processes.

![Pipeline Highlight](img/pipeline_page_log_highlight.png)

As shown above, your executed processes are displayed. These processes are either manually initiated—commonly during the process-building phase—or triggered by an event or schedule.

On this page, you can delve into each process to inspect its outputs step by step. You also have direct access to the corresponding project and workflow. Additionally, you can delete the log, as highlighted in red in the subsequent image.
