To place an action down onto the action palette, you can open the action category which contains the action you want and click on the action or drag it to the desired position.

Once you have placed down the action, it will open up the action for editing and you'll be presented with a screen similar to this one.

An action consists of a set of inputs which instruct the action how to run. Inputs can expect a variety of types such as:


- Text


- Numbers


- Coordinates


- Images


- Tables


- Lists

The input field will make it obvious which type it is expecting and Toca makes it very difficult to select the wrong type of input so you can avoid easily made mistakes.
Some inputs require interacting directly with the Bot screen so you can easily set the values. Examples of this include:


- Coordinates - just click where on the Bot screen you want to set the coordinates


- Images - Drag over the Bot screen to instantly capture an image


- Regions - Drag over the Bot to define a region


- Grids - Drag and adjust to define a grid

The Image Click action below shows how to capture an image and a region by dragging regions over the Bot screen:

Once an action has been saved and closed, you can hover over the action to see what operations can be performed.

Moving from left to right, these operations are:


- Play - An action can be played individually or it can be run as a step in an activity.


- Edit - Open the action so you can modify the inputs


- Duplicate - Copy the action and paste the copy directly under the current action


- Disable - Disabled actions will be skipped over when the activity is run, you can identify a disabled action as it will be greyed out


- Information - See the results the action returns


- Delete - Remove the action from the activity
