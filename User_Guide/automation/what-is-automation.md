An Automation Project is a place to create, store and manage your automated processes. They contain: 


- Activities


- Workflows


- Schedules


- Datastores




#### What is Automation?

Automation is a very broad term but in Toca, automation refers to the ability to perform parts of, or all of, a business process with no human involvement. Your Toca platform will come with 1 or more virtualized workers known as Bots and these Bots can autonomously perform tasks up to 24 hours a day.
A bot is an agent that runs on a Windows or Linux operating system and it can interact with any desktop applications in much the same way that you would. At the most simple level, it can perform mouse clicks and simulate keyboard inputs but the true power lies within the actions which perform interactions that a person could not possibly do. Through the Bot you can extract data from a browser with the click of a button, read text from images, incorporate AI into your workflow and do all of these much faster than previously possible.

#### What can I do with Automation?

One of the most important things to do before embarking on your automation project is to choose a business process that is well suited for automation. Processes which are good targets for automation exhibit the following characteristics:


- Repeatable


- Clearly defined rules


- Can be broken down into smaller steps

Whilst you are able to automate almost anything with Toca, it is good to be aware that not everything should be automated. For example, a quick one off process might take you longer to automate than it would to simply do it yourself.
