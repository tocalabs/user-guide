# Adding and Removing App Users



 
If you have set your App up to require user authentication then managing the users of your App is very important. At a minimum you're likely going to want to add users and remove them.

#### Add users

To add users go to the App's project page and locate the App Users section which can be found underneath the Publishing section on the right.

Click on the ADD USER + button at the top right of the users table.

A window will appear asking you to provide a user ID, username and password for the new user.

You can automatically generate a user ID by pressing the generate button at the end of the field.

Add the username and password and then click Add.

The new user will now appear in the users table.

It is important you add users like this rather than manually adding entries in the table in the Datastore. This is because when a user is added using the wizard it encrypts the password whilst if you added a new user manually then the password would not be encrypted and this would cause any login attempt for this user to fail.

#### Remove users

To remove a user click on their entry in the users table when you are in the App's project page. You can click anywhere on the row.

An edit window will appear that allows you to change details about the user and remove them. To remove the user simply click the bin icon in the top right corner.

A popup will appear asking you to confirm your choice to remove this user. Click YES to continue and remove the user and click NO to go back.

The user will no longer appear in the users table and will no longer be able to log into your App.
