# Publishing & Unpublishing Apps



The App Designer makes it very easy to design your app but when you have finished it you want to be able to distribute the app so others can use it. This is where publishing comes in, when you publish an app it packages up all the pages into a single website and hosts the website for you.
 
Let\'s take a look at how to do this.

#### Publish an App

Go to your App's project page and locate either of the publish buttons, they will appear in the top right corner.

A window will appear asking you to confirm your decision to publish this App and you'll be warned that this could make your App available to others. Click YES to continue and NO to cancel the publishing process.

Your App will then start the publishing process, this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes.

When your App has finished publishing you'll get a notification and also the App's project page will look like this:

#### Unpublish an App

If you ever need to unpublish your App then this is just the reverse of the publish process. Head to the App's project page and locate the Publish button which will appear in the top right corner.

Click \'Unpublish App\' and a window will appear asking you to confirm your decision.

Click YES to continue and unpublish the app and click NO to cancel and keep the App published. You'll get confirmation via a notification when your App has successfully been unpublished and your App's project page will go back to looking like this.
