# Setting up an App



To get started with Apps, lets navigate to the Projects page.

The Apps section lives on the right hand side of the projects page, underneath the recent projects.

To create a new App click the NEW + button.

This will open the App creation wizard which will guide you through the steps to create your App. Creating an App will take you through the following steps:


- Giving your App a name


- Linking any Automation projects


- Setting up user authentication if required


- Add a favicon (the icon that will appear in the browser tab once published to the web)


- Confirming your choices

If you wish to change any of the options after you have created your App you can also do that so don't worry about setting everything up perfectly when you first create the App.
Let's add a name to the App

Give a meaningful name which reflects the purpose of the App and click Next. This will take you to the next step of the setup process - Linking project resources.

### Linking Resources

If you wish to integrate some of your Automation projects to an App then this is an important step when creating your App.
Linking an Automation project to your App allows you to do the following:


- Start Workflows from an App



- Without user inputs


- With user inputs


- Display the outputs from Workflows in the App


- Add data to a Datastore in an Automation project from a users inputs in your App


- Drive content on your App from the contents of items in your Datastores

If any of these use cases sound like something you want to do then you should link up your App with the relevant Automation projects.

#### Link Projects

If you wish to link a Datastore to your App then you must first link the Project(s) which contains the Datastore(s) you wish to link. 
To do so, simply click on the dropdown of available projects to integrate.

Select the relevant project and this will link the project and then ask you which datastores from that project you wish to link.

![Setting up an App 7](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Setting%20up%20an%20App%207.png?width=534&name=Setting%20up%20an%20App%207.png) 

 

#### Link Datastores

Once you have selected the relevant project(s), you can now select the datastores you want. By linking a datastore this will allow your App to:


- Read data from your datastore


- Write data to your datastore

Click on the datastore dropdown and click the relevant datastore(s).

There is no limit to how many datastores or projects you can link so you can add however many resources you need.

#### Link Listeners

If you want the ability to run workflows from your App then you'll need to link listeners to your App as an App executes Workflows by calling a Listener. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of Listeners then refer to the Listeners section in the Automation Projects chapter.
Linking a Listener allows you to:


- Start a Workflow from your App


- Start a Workflow using a users inputs


- Display the outputs from a Workflow on your App

To add a Listener click on the Listener dropdown.

![Setting up an App 10](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Setting%20up%20an%20App%2010.png?width=541&name=Setting%20up%20an%20App%2010.png) 

This will show you a list of all currently active Listeners and it will also give you the opportunity to create a new listener.

Click the relevant option for you.
