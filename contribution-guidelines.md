## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- **Check Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please check if the problem has already been reported (link [here](https://github.com/tocalabs/user-guide/issues)).
- **Create a New Issue:** If your issue is unique, create a new issue and provide a detailed description of the problem, including the steps to reproduce it. Find the Github link [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) on how to create issues.

## Style Guidelines

Make sure to follow our [Style Guide](link-to-style-guide) to maintain consistency across the codebase.

## Proposing Changes

1. **Fork the Repository:** If you're not a project maintainer, start by forking the repository.

2. **Create a Feature Branch:** All changes should be made in a feature branch, created from the latest version of the main branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-branch
    ```

3. **Make Your Changes:** Update the documentation as needed. Be sure to follow our [Style Guide](link-to-style-guide) for consistency.

4. **Commit Your Changes:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of changes made"
   ```

5. **Push the Branch:**

   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request (PR) for review. Include a clear description of the changes and the reason for the update.

7. **Peer Review:** All updates must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. This ensures accuracy, adherence to our standards, and alignment with the overall goals of the documentation.

8. **Merge the Changes:** Once approved, the changes will be merged into the main branch. The main branch is locked, and direct changes are not permitted to ensure the integrity of the documentation.
